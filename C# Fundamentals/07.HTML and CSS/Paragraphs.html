    <h1>Top Tips for Effective Presentations</h1>
    <p>
        This page draws on published <strong>advice</strong> from expert presenters around the world, which will help to
        take your presentations from merely <b>good</b> to <b>great</b>.By bringing together advice from a wide range of people,
        the aim is to cover a whole range of areas.Whether you are an experienced presenter, or just starting out,
        there should be ideas here to help you to <b>improve</b>.
        <strong>It’s hard to be relaxed and be yourself when you’re nervous.</strong>
        But time and again, the great presenters say that the most important thing is to connect with your audience, and
        the best way to do that is to let your passion for the subject shine through.
        Be honest <em>with the audience about what is important to you and why it matters.</em>
        <strong> Your presentation needs to be built around what your audience is going to get out of the presentation.</strong>
        As you prepare the presentation, you always need to bear in mind what the audience needs and wants to know, not
        what you can tell them.
        <em> While you’re giving the presentation, you also need to remain focused on your audience’s response, and react to
        that.<em>
